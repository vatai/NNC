#+TITLE: Running Keras programs on IST servers (with GPUs) using Singularity

This short document describes how to run Keras applications (with Tensorflow kernel) on IST servers at The University of Tokyo.
The main software used is Singularity, a ... software.

* Overview
  The step needed to set everything up can be divided into two groups: 
  - in the first part we build the Singularity image, usually on a 'local' computer, where we have ~sudo~ access;
  - which is later run no the IST
* Local host
* Remote host
