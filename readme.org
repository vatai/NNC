#+TITLE: Experiments for the paper "Compression with insight into layers of deep neural networks"

* Important remark about the code
Due to an oversight there is a name collision.  There are two "small" values in the paper \delta and \varepsilon.  In the source code they are both referred to as \varepsilon.
Usually the ~epsilon~ or ~eps~ variables refer to the \delta, and \varepsilon is only dealt with in ~epsilons.py~.
